Welcome! This is a mod I made as a moving present for a friend who went to live in New Zealand. I decided to polish it up and release it to the public. It is inspired by the [Cute Kiwi Birds mod by Lordloss_](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cute-kiwi-birds-new-animal) which hasn't been updated since 1.16. All code and assets are original.

### FEATURES

* Kiwi birds **spawn in most forest biomes**.
* They will occasionally **dig for items**, including seeds, berries, and sometimes nuggets of iron and gold, according to a loot table that can be configured using a data pack.
* They can be **bred with seeds**, and they **lay eggs** which work the same way as chicken eggs.
* If you slay a kiwi bird (you monster) they will drop **kiwifruit** which can be eaten or crafted into delicious **pavlova**.
* There is a small chance that a **laser kiwi** will spawn instead of a normal one. Watch out.
* Just like real life, kiwi birds are **vulnerable to invasive predators**. Don't let your pet cats get too close!

### NOTES
